# 64_char_string_sha256
This script creates a hexadecimal string of 64 characters, then hashes it, saving the output in a log file as a database.
The idea behind it is:
  A lot of faucet websites use Hexadecimal strings to generate your wins. To prove they are not lying they show a hash of the string beforehand.

# Notes by thqmas:
1. Need to clear again what the code is for.
2. What is the first input (string) to input for example (for the laymen).
3. this is just in relation to my learning process and assignment I have. You do not need to accept my pull request. it was made in the scope of an assignment (as allready stated).
